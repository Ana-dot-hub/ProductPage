                    <p>We are a medium-sized family operated coffee business. Our farm is located in the south east corner of Guatemala near the border with El Salvador on a small volcano called Moyuta. The coffee from our region (Nuevo Oriente or New Eastern region) is composed primarily of small to medium-sized plantations and the roasted coffee tends to have notes of chocolate in the cup and aftertaste. </p>
                    <p>The harvest takes place once a year from December through February. The coffee, in its cherry form, is handpicked and carefully selected for ripeness, then taken for processing where the cherries are de-pulped and sent to fermentation tanks. After a controlled fermentation, the beans are washed of all sticky pulp and set to dry on cement patios. The wet-mill system we use recycles water to minimize environmental impact.</p>
